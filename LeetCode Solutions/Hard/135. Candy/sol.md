1. Initialize an array `a` of size `n` and initialize all elements to 1.
2. Iterate over the array `arr` from left to right:
    * If the current element is smaller than the next element, then update the value of `a[i + 1]` to `1 + a[i]`.
3. Iterate over the array `arr` from right to left:
    * If the current element is smaller than the previous element and `a[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `a[i]`, then update the value of `a[i - 1]` to `a[i] + 1`.
4. Calculate the sum of all elements in the array `a` and return the sum.

**Example:**

Consider the following input:

arr = [1, 2, 2]

The output is 4.

**Explanation:**

The value of the array `a` after each iteration of the loop is as follows:

| Iteration | i | arr[i] | a[i] |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 |

The sum of all elements in the array `a` is 4. Therefore, the minimum number of candies required is 4.

**Conclusion:**

The `candy()` function is an efficient way to calculate the minimum number of candies required to distribute to children.
