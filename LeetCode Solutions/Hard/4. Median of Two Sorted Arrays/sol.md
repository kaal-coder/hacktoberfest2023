**Algorithm:**

1. Create a new array `merged` of size `m.length + n.length` to store the merged sorted array.
2. Initialize three pointers `i`, `j`, and `k`. `i` and `j` will point to the first elements of the arrays `m` and `n`, respectively. `k` will point to the first element of the array `merged`.
3. While `i` is less than the length of `m` and `j` is less than the length of `n`:
    * If the element at `i` in `m` is less than or equal to the element at `j` in `n`:
        * Copy the element at `i` in `m` to the element at `k` in `merged`.
        * Increment `i` and `k`.
    * Otherwise:
        * Copy the element at `j` in `n` to the element at `k` in `merged`.
        * Increment `j` and `k`.
4. While `i` is less than the length of `m`:
    * Copy the element at `i` in `m` to the element at `k` in `merged`.
    * Increment `i` and `k`.
5. While `j` is less than the length of `n`:
    * Copy the element at `j` in `n` to the element at `k` in `merged`.
    * Increment `j` and `k`.
6. Calculate the middle index of the array `merged`.
7. If the length of the array `merged` is even:
    * Return the average of the two elements at the middle index and the middle index minus one.
8. Otherwise:
    * Return the element at the middle index.

**Time complexity:** O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the arrays `m` and `n`, respectively. This is because we only need to iterate over the two arrays once.

**Space complexity:** O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the arrays `m` and `n`, respectively. This is because we need to store the merged array `merged`.

for example, consider the following two arrays:


m = [1, 3, 5, 7]
n = [2, 4, 6, 8]

The merged array will be:

merged = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

The middle index of the merged array is 3. Therefore, the function will return the average of the two elements at index 3 and index 2, which is `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`.
