1. Create a map `graph` to store the adjacency list of the graph, where the keys are the airports and the values are priority queues of the next airports that can be visited from the current airport.
2. Iterate over the `tickets` list and add each ticket to the `graph` map.
3. Create a linked list `itinerary` to store the itinerary.
4. Call the `dfs()` function with the starting airport, the `graph` map, and the `itinerary` linked list.

The `dfs()` function works recursively to find a path from the current airport to the end of the itinerary. It does this by repeatedly removing the next airport from the priority queue and calling itself on that airport. When the priority queue is empty, the function adds the current airport to the `itinerary` linked list.

**Example:**

Consider the following input:

tickets = [[["JFK", "SFO"], ["JFK", "ATL"], ["SFO", "ATL"], ["ATL", "JFK"]]]

The output is `["JFK", "ATL", "JFK", "SFO"]`.

**Explanation:**

The `graph` map after the iteration over the `tickets` list is as follows:

graph = {
  "JFK": ["ATL", "SFO"],
  "ATL": ["JFK"],
  "SFO": ["ATL"]
}

The `dfs()` function is called with the starting airport "JFK" as follows:

dfs("JFK", graph, itinerary);

The `dfs()` function will recursively call itself on the next airports in the priority queue of "JFK", which are "ATL" and "SFO". The `dfs()` function will eventually reach the end of the itinerary and return. The `itinerary` linked list will then contain the following airports in order:

["JFK", "ATL", "JFK", "SFO"]

Therefore, the output of the `findItinerary()` function is `["JFK", "ATL", "JFK", "SFO"]`.
