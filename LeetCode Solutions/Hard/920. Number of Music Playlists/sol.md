**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a 2D array `temp` to store the number of playlists that can be created with `i` songs and `j` unique songs.
2. Set the value of `temp[0][0]` to 1, since there is only one playlist that can be created with 0 songs and 0 unique songs.
3. Iterate over the `temp` array, starting at `(1, 1)`:
    * For each index `(i, j)`, calculate the number of playlists that can be created with `i` songs and `j` unique songs as follows:
        * Add the number of playlists that can be created with `i - 1` songs and `j - 1` unique songs, multiplied by the number of unique songs that can be added to the playlist.
        * If `j > k`, then add the number of playlists that can be created with `i - 1` songs and `j` unique songs, multiplied by the number of ways to reuse a song that has already been played in the playlist.
4. Return the value of `temp[goal][n]`, which is the number of playlists that can be created with `goal` songs and `n` unique songs.

**Time complexity:** O(n * goal), where n is the number of unique songs and goal is the number of songs in the playlist.

**Space complexity:** O(n * goal), where n is the number of unique songs and goal is the number of songs in the playlist.

for example, consider the following input:

n = 3
goal = 3
k = 1

The `temp` array will be filled like this:

temp = [[1, 3, 6],
        [0, 3, 6],
        [0, 0, 3]]

The answer is `temp[goal][n] = 3`, which is the number of playlists that can be created with 3 songs and 3 unique songs.
