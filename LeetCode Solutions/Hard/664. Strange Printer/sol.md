**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a 2D array `temp` to store the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from `start` to `end`, inclusive.
2. If `start` is greater than `end`, then return 0, since the substring is empty and requires no turns to print.
3. If the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from `start` to `end` is already stored in `temp`, then return the value from `temp`.
4. Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from `start` to `end` as follows:
    * Calculate the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from `start` to `end - 1` and add 1.
    * For each index `i` from `start` to `end - 1`:
        * If the character at index `i` is equal to the character at index `end`:
            * Calculate the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from `start` to `i` and the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from `i + 1` to `end - 1`.
            * Update the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from `start` to `end` to the minimum of the current minimum and the sum of the minimum number of turns required to print the two substrings.
5. Store the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from `start` to `end` in the `temp` array.
6. Return the minimum number of turns required to print the substring from `start` to `end`.

**Time complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the length of the string.

**Space complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the length of the string.

for example, consider string, s = "aaabbb"

The minimum number of turns required to print the substring from `0` to `5`, inclusive, is calculated like this:

minTurns(s, 0, 5, temp)
= min(minTurns(s, 0, 4, temp) + 1, minTurns(s, 0, 0, temp) + minTurns(s, 1, 5, temp))
= min(minTurns(s, 0, 3, temp) + 2, 0 + minTurns(s, 1, 5, temp))
= min(minTurns(s, 0, 2, temp) + 3, 0 + minTurns(s, 1, 4, temp))
= min(minTurns(s, 0, 1, temp) + 4, 0 + minTurns(s, 1, 3, temp))
= min(minTurns(s, 0, 0, temp) + 5, 0 + minTurns(s, 1, 2, temp))
= min(0 + 6, 0 + minTurns(s, 1, 1, temp))
= min(0 + 6, 0 + 0)
= 0

Therefore, the minimum number of turns required to print the string `s` is 0.
