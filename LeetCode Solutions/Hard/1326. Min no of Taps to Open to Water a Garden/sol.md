1. Create an array `arr` of size `n + 1` and initialize all elements to 0.
2. Iterate over the `ranges` array:
    * For each element in the `ranges` array, if the element is equal to 0, skip it.
    * Otherwise, update the elements of `arr` at indices `i - ranges[i]` and `i + ranges[i]` to the maximum of the current value and `i + ranges[i]`. This ensures that the `arr` array stores the maximum distance that can be reached from each index.
3. Initialize two variables: `end` and `far_can_reach`.
    * `end` represents the maximum index that can be reached using the current set of taps.
    * `far_can_reach` represents the maximum distance that can be reached from any tap.
4. Initialize a counter variable `cnt` to 0.
5. Iterate over the `arr` array:
    * If the current index `i` is greater than `end`, then the current set of taps cannot reach `i`.
        * If `far_can_reach` is less than or equal to `end`, then there is no set of taps that can reach all indices in the array.
        * Otherwise, update `end` to `far_can_reach` and increment `cnt`.
    * Update `far_can_reach` to the maximum of its current value and `arr[i]`.
6. If `end` is less than `n`, then the current set of taps cannot reach all indices in the array. Increment `cnt` in this case.
7. Return `cnt`.

**Example:**

Consider the following input:

n = 5
ranges = [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]

The output is 2.

**Explanation:**

The `arr` array after the iteration over the `ranges` array is as follows:

arr = [1, 3, 4, 4, 4]

The `end` and `far_can_reach` variables are initialized to 0.

The iteration over the `arr` array is as follows:

| Iteration | i | end | far_can_reach | cnt |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 1 |
| 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 1 |
| 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 1 |

Since `end` is less than `n`, we increment `cnt` to 2.

Therefore, the minimum number of taps required to water the entire garden is 2.

**Conclusion:**

The `minTaps()` function is an efficient way to calculate the minimum number of taps required to water the entire garden.
