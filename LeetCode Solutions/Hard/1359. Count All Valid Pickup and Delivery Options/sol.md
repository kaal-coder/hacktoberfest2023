1. Initialize a variable `count` to 1.
2. Iterate over the integers from 2 to `n`, inclusive:
    * Multiply `count` by the product of `2 * i - 1` and `i`.
    * Take the remainder of the product by the modulus `MOD`, which is 1000000007.
3. Return `count`.

The product `2 * i - 1` represents the number of ways to order `i` items if each item must be placed before the next item. For example, if we have 3 items, we can order them in 6 ways:

1. 2. 3.
2. 3. 1.
3. 3. 2.
4. 1. 2. 3.
5. 1. 3. 2.
6. 2. 1. 3.

The product `i` represents the number of ways to order `i` items if there are no restrictions on the order. For example, if we have 3 items, we can order them in 6 ways:

1. 1. 2. 3.
2. 1. 3. 2.
3. 2. 1. 3.
4. 2. 3. 1.
5. 3. 1. 2.
6. 3. 2. 1.

Therefore, the product `(2 * i - 1) * i` represents the number of ways to order `i` items if each item must be placed before the next item and there are no restrictions on the order of the items within each group.

The modulus `MOD` is used to ensure that the value of `count` does not exceed the maximum value of an integer.

**Example:**

Consider the following input:

n = 3

The output is 6.

**Explanation:**

The value of `count` after each iteration of the loop is as follows:

| Iteration | i | count |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 | 3 * 1 = 3 |
| 3 | 4 | 6 * 3 = 18 |

Since the modulus `MOD` is 1000000007, the value of `count` after the final iteration is 18. Therefore, the number of ways to order 4 items is 18.
