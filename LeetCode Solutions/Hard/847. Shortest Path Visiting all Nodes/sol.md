1. Initialize an adjacency list `adjacentList` to store the graph.
2. Initialize a priority queue `queue` to store the nodes in the graph, where the priority of a node is the number of neighbors it has.
3. Iterate over the graph and add each node to the `adjacentList` and the `queue`.
4. Initialize a minimum path length `minLen` to infinity.
5. While the `queue` is not empty:
    * Remove the first node `start` from the `queue`.
    * Initialize a visited array `visited` to keep track of the nodes that have been visited.
    * Call the `getLen()` function to calculate the length of the shortest path from the current node `start` to all other nodes in the graph.
    * If the shortest path from the current node `start` to all other nodes in the graph is valid, then update the minimum path length `minLen`.
6. Return the minimum path length `minLen`.

The `getLen()` function works recursively to calculate the length of the shortest path from the current node `start` to all other nodes in the graph. It does this by repeatedly adding the current node to the visited array and calling itself on the neighbors of the current node. When the visited array contains all of the nodes in the graph, the function returns the length of the shortest path.

**Example:**

Consider the following input:

graph = [[1, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 4], [2, 3]]

The adjacency list `adjacentList` after the initialization is as follows:

adjacentList = [[1, 2], [0, 3, 4], [0, 4], [1, 4], [2, 3]]

The priority queue `queue` after the initialization is as follows:

queue = [1, 2, 0, 3, 4]

The `getLen()` function is called with the starting node "0" as follows:

getLen(adjacentList, visited, 0);

The `getLen()` function will recursively call itself on the neighbors of the current node "0", which are "1" and "2". The `getLen()` function will eventually reach the end of the recursion and return the length of the shortest path from the current node "0" to all other nodes in the graph, which is 4.

The minimum path length `minLen` is updated to 4.

The `queue` is now empty, so the algorithm terminates and returns the minimum path length `minLen`, which is 4.
