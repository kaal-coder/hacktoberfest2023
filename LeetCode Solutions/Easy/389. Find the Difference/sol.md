**Algorithm:**

1. Calculate the sum of the ASCII codes of all the characters in the first string, `s`.
2. Calculate the sum of the ASCII codes of all the characters in the second string, `t`.
3. Subtract the sum of the ASCII codes of `s` from the sum of the ASCII codes of `t`.
4. Return the character represented by the difference.

**Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the longer string.

**Space complexity:** O(1), as we only use a few constant variables.

for example, consider the following two strings:

s = "ABCDELMN"
t = "ABCFGLMN"


The sum of the ASCII codes of all the characters in `s` is:

A + B + C + D + E + L + M + N = 65 + 66 + 67 + 68 + 69 + 76 + 77 + 78 = 536

The sum of the ASCII codes of all the characters in `t` is:

A + B + C + F + G + L + M + N = 65 + 66 + 67 + 70 + 71 + 76 + 77 + 78 = 540

The difference between the sum of the ASCII codes of `t` and `s` is 540 - 536 = 4

The character represented by 4 is `F`. Therefore, the function will return `F`.
