**Algorithm:**

1. Check if the first element of the array is less than the last element.
2. If it is, then iterate over the array from the second element to the last element.
3. For each element, check if it is less than the previous element.
4. If any element is less than the previous element, then the array is not monotonic and the function should return `false`.
5. Otherwise, the array is monotonic and the function should return `true`.
6. If the first element of the array is greater than the last element, then iterate over the array from the second element to the last element.
7. For each element, check if it is greater than the previous element.
8. If any element is greater than the previous element, then the array is not monotonic and the function should return `false`.
9. Otherwise, the array is monotonic and the function should return `true`.

**Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.

**Space complexity:** O(1), as we only use a few constant variables.

for example, consider the following array:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

This array is monotonic because each element is greater than or equal to the previous element.

If we call the `isMonotonic()` function on this array, the following steps will be taken:

1. The function will check if the first element of the array is less than the last element. It is, so the function will continue to the next step.
2. The function will iterate over the array from the second element to the last element.
3. For each element, the function will check if it is less than the previous element. None of the elements are less than the previous element, so the function will continue to the next step.
4. The function will return `true` because the array is monotonic.

Therefore, the `isMonotonic()` function will return `true` in this case.
