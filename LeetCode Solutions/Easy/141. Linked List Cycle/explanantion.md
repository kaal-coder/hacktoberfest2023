**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to the head of the linked list.
2. Iterate while `fast` is not null and `fast.next` is not null.
3. Move `slow` one node forward.
4. Move `fast` two nodes forward.
5. If `slow` and `fast` ever meet, then there is a cycle in the linked list.
6. Return `true` if there is a cycle, or `false` otherwise.

**Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the linked list.

**Space complexity:** O(1), as we only use two pointers.

**Explanation:**

The `hasCycle()` function works by using two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to traverse the linked list. The `slow` pointer moves one node forward at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two nodes forward at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, then the `slow` and `fast` pointers will eventually meet at some point. This is because the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer.

For example, consider the following linked list:

head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 (4 points back to 3)

There is a cycle in this linked list because the `next` pointer of the node with the value `4` points back to the node with the value `3`.

If we call the `hasCycle()` function on this linked list, the `slow` and `fast` pointers will eventually meet at the node with the value `3`. This is because the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer.

Therefore, the `hasCycle()` function returns `true` in this case.
