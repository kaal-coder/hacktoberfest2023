**Algorithm:**

1. Create a priority queue to store the sum of soldiers in each row.
2. Iterate over the matrix and for each row, calculate the sum of soldiers.
3. Add the row number and the sum of soldiers to the priority queue.
4. Create an array to store the weakest rows.
5. Iterate over the priority queue and add the row number of the weakest row to the array.
6. Return the array of weakest rows.

**Time complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of rows in the matrix. This is because we need to sort the priority queue, which takes O(log n) time per operation.

**Space complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of rows in the matrix. This is because we need to store the priority queue, which can hold up to n rows.

For example, consider the following matrix:

[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]]


The priority queue will be initialized as follows:

[1, 5]
[1, 4]
[1, 3]
[1, 2]
[1, 1]

The function will then return the following array:


[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]


This is because the first row has the most soldiers, followed by the second row, and so on.
