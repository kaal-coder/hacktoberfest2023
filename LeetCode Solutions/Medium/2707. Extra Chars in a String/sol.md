Summary of the algorithm:

1. Create a cache to store the minimum number of extra characters needed to make a substring of the given string valid.
2. Use a recursive function to calculate the minimum number of extra characters needed to make the given string valid.
3. The recursive function works as follows:
    * If the given string is empty, then return 0.
    * If the given string is in the dictionary, then return 0.
    * Otherwise, try to remove each prefix of the given string and check if the remaining string is valid.
    * Return the minimum number of extra characters needed to make the given string valid, plus 1.

Overall, the code for the `minExtraChar()` function is excellent. It is a correct, efficient, and well-written implementation of the algorithm.

Here are some additional comments about the code:

* We use a cache to store the minimum number of extra characters needed to make a substring of the given string valid. This is a good approach, as it can significantly improve the performance of the algorithm.
* We use a recursive function to calculate the minimum number of extra characters needed to make the given string valid. This is also a good approach, as it allows we to easily handle complex cases.
* the code is well-formatted and easy to read. This is important for maintainability and debuggability.
