1. Initialize two variables `countA` and `countB` to keep track of the number of times the characters `A` and `B` appear in consecutive groups of three, respectively.
2. Iterate over the input string `colors`:
    * If the current character and the next two characters are all the same, then increment the corresponding counter `countA` or `countB` depending on the character.
3. Return `true` if `countA` is greater than `countB`, otherwise return `false`.

**Example:**

Consider the following input:


colors = "ABBBBAA"


The algorithm will work as follows:


Iteration | i | colors.charAt(i - 1) | colors.charAt(i) | colors.charAt(i + 1) | countA | countB
-------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1        | 1 | A | B | B | 0 | 0
2        | 2 | B | B | B | 0 | 1
3        | 3 | B | B | A | 0 | 1
4        | 4 | B | A | A | 1 | 1
5        | 5 | A | A | A | 2 | 1
6        | 6 | A | A | B | 2 | 1


The output of the algorithm is `true`, since `countA` is greater than `countB`.
