1. Initialize the target value to the sum of all elements in the input array `nums` minus the desired value `x`.
2. If the target value is less than zero, then return -1, since it is impossible to find a subarray with a sum greater than or equal to `x`.
3. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning of the array.
4. Initialize the current sum `curSum` to zero.
5. Initialize the maximum subarray length `maxSubLength` to the minimum value of an integer.
6. While the right pointer is less than the length of the array:
    * Add the element at the right pointer to the current sum.
    * While the current sum is greater than the target value:
        * Subtract the element at the left pointer from the current sum.
        * Increment the left pointer.
    * If the current sum is equal to the target value, then update the maximum subarray length `maxSubLength` to the maximum of the current length and the right pointer minus the left pointer plus 1.
7. Increment the right pointer.
8. Return the difference between the length of the array `nums` and the maximum subarray length `maxSubLength`.

This algorithm works by sliding a window over the array, keeping track of the current sum of the elements in the window. If the current sum is greater than the target value, then the algorithm shrinks the window by removing the element at the left pointer. If the current sum is equal to the target value, then the algorithm updates the maximum subarray length. The algorithm terminates when the right pointer reaches the end of the array.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because the algorithm traverses the array once.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), since it only needs to store a few variables.
