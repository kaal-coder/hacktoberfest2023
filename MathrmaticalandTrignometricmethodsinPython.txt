MATHEMATICAL OPRATIONS USING NUMPY
	1. + operation using add() method
	2.  - operation using subtract() method
	3. *operation using multiply() method. We can also use @(multiplication of first row and first column likewise) symbol as matrix multiplication. We can also use syntax for the same' array1.dot(array2)'
	4. / operation using divide() method
	5. In order to find maximum value of an array use max() function and to find the index of maximum integer use argmax() function
	6. In order to find maximum element in a row or a column using axis =0 or 1 as an argument in max() function. Here 0 is for columns and 1 is for rows.
	7. In order to find minimum value of a matrix use min() method and for its index use argmin() method.
	8. In order to find the sum of all elements of a matrix use sum() method
	9. In order to calculate the sum of elements of a row or column just pass array and axis as an argument in sum() method
	10. In order to find the average of elements of a matrix use mean(arrayname) method
	11. In order to find square root of each element in a matrix use sqrt() method
	12. In order to find standard division of a matrix  use std() function
	13. In order to find exponent of each element in a matrix use exp() method
	14. To find log of each element of a matrix use log() method
	15. In order to find log base 10 use log10() method

FINDING TRIGNOMETRIC FUNCTIONS USING NUMPY LIBRARY

	1. In order to get graphs we'll use "matplotlib" library. It consists of an plot known as "plyplot"Matplotlib.pyplot will be its syntax.
	2. Firstly  get the vakue of x-axis ussing arange() method.
	3. Then go for y-axis
	4. To get the value of pi use np.pi
	5. To get the graph of sin use the syntax plt.plot(xaxis,yaxis) and then use show() method.
	6. plot() method is used for representation of graph
	7. In order to get valued in angles (before we're getting values in degrees) multiply with pi and use formula syntax is here np. sin(180 *np.pi /180)
