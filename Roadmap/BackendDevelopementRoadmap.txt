1. Month 1-2: Fundamentals

Spend the first two months on programming fundamentals, version control, and getting familiar with the command line.
Aim to complete introductory courses and exercises in these areas.


2. Month 3-5: Backend Technologies

Pick a backend language (e.g., Python, JavaScript) and learn its basics.(You can either start with Js or python).
Start working with a simple server-side framework (e.g., Flask for Python or Express for JavaScript) to build basic applications.
Begin exploring databases and API development.
Consider building a basic blog or task manager application.


3. Month 6-8: Advanced Backend Concepts

Deepen your understanding of databases and explore NoSQL databases(eg.mongodb).
Dive into authentication, authorization, and security.
Learn about caching and basic scalability concepts.
Start building more complex applications and experiment with different database types.

#OPTIONAL
4. Month 9-12: Tools and DevOps (July - October)

Explore automation and CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
Learn about cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) and practice deploying applications.
Begin working with containerization (e.g., Docker) and infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform).
Aim to build and deploy a project in the cloud.


5. Month 13-16: Soft Skills and Ongoing Learning

Dedicate time to improving communication, problem-solving, and collaboration skills.
Focus on documentation and working on personal projects.
Stay updated with the latest trends and consider contributing to open source projects.
Please note that this is a rough estimate, and the actual timeline can vary. Some individuals may progress faster or slower depending on their background, the complexity of projects, and the amount of time they can dedicate to learning. Additionally, learning is an ongoing process, and you'll continue to refine your skills and explore advanced topics as you gain experience in the field.

NOTE: Creating a practical roadmap with time estimates can be challenging, as the timeline for becoming a proficient backend developer can vary greatly based on factors such as prior experience, the complexity of the projects you work on, and the amount of time you can dedicate to learning. However, I can provide a rough estimate of how long it might take(6-8 months) to go through the topics outlined in the previous roadmap, assuming you're starting now.
